## Data and Pretrained checkpoints
You can download the Messy Rooms (MOS) dataset from [here](https://figshare.com/s/b195ce8bd8eafe79762b). For all other datasets, refer to
the instructions provided in [Panoptic-Lifting](https://github.com/nihalsid/panoptic-lifting)



we provide **pretrained checkpoints** for MOS dataset and you can download them from [here](https://mycuhk-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/1155183723_link_cuhk_edu_hk/EYVeG_sGhRVEtEoZoh9nj_kB6VwTBa22kqWCcEeD5BqsyA?e=9MlcYd).

## Inference and Evaluation.
Download the pretrained checkpoints and place them to ```./code```. Then, run the following commands to evaluate the pretrained models:
```
cd code & python inference_test/MOS_covariance/covariance_001_clamp/bash_inference_training_view_official_v2_learned_covariance_v1.py --output_dir PCF_res --feature_dimension 7 --export_table_name PCF_res 
```

## Training
```
cd code & bash train.sh
```
